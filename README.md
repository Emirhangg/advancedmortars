### Advanced Mortars

This mod is designed for modpack makers. It contains only example recipes and is intended to be used with CraftTweaker. JEI integration is supported, however item transfer functionality has been intentionally omitted.

##### Insertion

Place up to eight stacks of items in the mortar by right-clicking the mortar while holding the items. Then, perform the craft by right-clicking or holding down the right mouse button with an empty hand. 

##### Retrieval

Retrieve items in the mortar by sneaking and right-clicking the mortar with an empty hand.

##### Pick-Up

The mortar can easily be picked up and moved by sneaking and left-clicking the mortar. When picked up this way, the mortar will retain its contents.

#### Recipes

Four crafting recipes have been added, one for each mortar.

Two example recipes for each mortar are also included. The example recipes are intended for modpack makers to quickly grab the mod and test its functionality without having to first supply recipes via CraftTweaker and ZenScript. These recipes can be quickly and easily disabled in the config.
